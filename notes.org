* Program Notes

** Integration Approximation Algorithm

   - The current plan is to use Simpson's rule to approximate the integrals.
   - Watch patrickJMT's video on the derivation of Simpson's rule, as
     well as his video on error bounds when using Simpson's rule.

** Formula Parsing Algorithm
   
   - Investigate the shunting yard algorithm.
   - Investigate whether converting to postfix notation or abstract
     syntax tree is more efficient for calculations.
